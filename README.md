# google-clone

This project will be a perfect clone of the google homepage.
The code will be all written by myself, and only by myself, and the only reference that I will use in order to make this clone is the google homepage itself. I will be looking at it from a user's perspective and using the code that I think will reproduce the same result. Any similarities with code written by other people is pure coincidence.     

I see a lot of google clones out there, but none of them impressed me yet ! All of them look fake, so I decided to make one that will look exactly identical to the original google homepage.
